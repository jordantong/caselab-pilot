# 📋 Clipboard Client Chat (a.k.a. “Case-y”)

**Clipboard Client Chat** is an interactive Streamlit chatbot designed for business students to practice consulting-style problem solving.  
It simulates a **client** (like a product manager) who reveals information only when asked targeted, relevant questions.  
The case content is modeled after a marketplace pricing scenario — similar to Lyft’s driver/rider economics.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Give students a realistic client to “interview” during a case analysis exercise  
- Encourage thoughtful, iterative questioning rather than direct data requests  
- Enable instructors to control usage and costs through quotas and access codes
